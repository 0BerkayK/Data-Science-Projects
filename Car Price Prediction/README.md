# About the Project

About Dataset
Used Car Prices in UK Dataset is a comprehensive collection of automotive information extracted from the popular automotive marketplace website, autotrader.co.uk. This dataset comprises 3,685 data points, each representing a unique vehicle listing, and includes thirteen distinct features providing valuable insights into the world of automobiles. The feature names are:

* year
* price
* transmission
* mileage
* tax
* mpg
* engineSize

## Importing the Dataset

I got the data set in Excel from kaggle.com and imported it into my project.

- Activation Function

  Essentially, the activation function learns data structures and generates a meaningful result. In this project, I used the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function.

- Rectified Linear Unit

  In the context of artificial neural networks, the rectifier or ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function is an activation function defined as the positive part of its argument:
